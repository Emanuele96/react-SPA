For My Teacher At Christmas

Christmas vacation is great;
My time is mine to spend;
I can be with friends or watch TV;
 I wish it would never end.

I don't miss school or homework;
 I really like to be free;
But I'll miss you when I'm gone from school;
 You're just what a teacher should be.

So have a perfect Christmas;
Be sure to have lots of fun;
I look forward to seeing you again,
 When Christmas vacation is done.
