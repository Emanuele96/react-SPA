Family Joys

Christmas is filled with special joys,
And the very best of all
Is contemplating those dear to us,
 And the memories we recall.

We often think at Christmas time
 Of people, affectionately,
And we realize how blessed we are
 To have you in our family.

(or, "To be in your family," or, "To be part of your family.")
