Valentine Gift

On Valentine's Day,
I'm thinking about
the special ways
you have made my life better,
the little things,
the not-so-little things...
your kindness,
the way you always listen
and pay attention to me.
You make my world
brighter and richer.
You're a gift to me,
and I thank you
for being you.
